# Laptop Recommendation Chatbot using LangChain

This project is an AI-powered chatbot assistant that helps users find suitable laptops based on their requirements. It uses a local CSV dataset of laptops, processes the data into searchable chunks, and uses natural language processing (NLP) to answer queries intelligently.

---

## Project Structure

- **Dataset**: A CSV file with laptop details (features, price, brand, etc.)
- **LangChain**: For chaining LLM tools and managing retrieval-based question answering.
- **FAISS**: Vector store to store and search document embeddings.
- **HuggingFace Embeddings**: For converting text into numerical vectors.
- **Ollama (LLaMA3)**: Local LLM for understanding and refining queries.

##Project Flow

1. **Load CSV File**
We load the dataset using `CSVLoader` from LangChain:

2. Split Text into Chunks
To make the text searchable, we split it into smaller pieces:

3. Generate Embeddings
Use HuggingFace's all-mpnet-base-v2 model to convert text into embeddings:

4. Semantic Search
Allow users to ask questions, and find relevant chunks from the dataset:

5. Refine User Query with LLM
We use an LLM (LLaMA3 via Ollama) to rewrite user queries into structured filter requirements:

6. Answer Questions with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
Using LangChain's RetrievalQA, we retrieve data and generate answers:

7. Build an Intelligent Agent
Use LangChain's Agent to handle conversational flows with memory and tools:

8. Example Interaction
response = agent_executor.run("Show me Dell laptops under â‚¹50000")
followup = agent_executor.run("Only i5 models please")

Requirements
Python 3.8+
Libraries:
pandas
